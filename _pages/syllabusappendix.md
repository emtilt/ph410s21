# Additional Syllabus Information for PH410

## Course Catalog description
PH 410. ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM (3). Studies
Coulomb’s law through the electromagnetic field of moving
charge. Develops electrostatic fields in vacuum and in dielectrics,
magnetic fields associated with constant and variable currents in
vacuum and in magnetic materials, Maxwell’s synthesis, and the
propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, in dielectrics
and in good conductors. Prerequisite(s): MT 360C and PH 304B. 

## Student Learning Outcomes	
Students in this course will learn to
- Connect the physics of electricity and magnetism to its representation as a mathematics problem, and use the tech- niques of vector calculus to determine a solution. Physics topics will include: electric fields and potentials, Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law, Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations, polarization and dielectrics, currents, magnetic fields, the Biot- Savart law, Ampère’s law, the vector potential, magnetization and bound currents, the H field, induction, Maxwell’s equations, and electromagnetic waves.
- Apply techniques such as separation of variables, the method of images, and multipole expansions to solve boundary- value problems with partial differential equations.
- Communicate solutions to sophisticated physics problems effectively.

As such, this course directly addresses the following department-level student learning outcomes (SLOs) set by the Department of Physics and Astronomy:
- Knowledge of the fundamental principles of analytical mechanics, special relativity, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics
- Ability to apply the principles of physics to solve qualitative and quantitative problems using both analytical and computational methods


## Attendance policy
Attendance at every course meeting is expected. Activities completed in class will affect the participation category of the course grade, and may not be completed late in the case of an unexcused absence.

## Excused absence policy
Excused absences will be granted in compliance with Regis College policies. Graded work that is missed due to medical or University-sanctioned athletics will be excused, but you remain responsible for the material missed.

## Incomplete policy
If unforeseen circumstances occur, and a student is unable to complete the required work for the course, an “Incomplete” grade may be submitted.  A request must be made in writing and approved by the instructor.  The request will include a timeline and plan for completing the work.  The incomplete grade will reflect the grade earned in the course to this point ( an “I” with whatever grade earned, including the missing work: an IF or ID or IC) and will only change when the plan is completed. Please see the University Catalog for more of the full policy: “A grade of an Incomplete or “I” denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to **unforeseen** circumstances” (emphasis added), which means “an accident, an illness, a death or major life transaction has occurred.”

## Key dates
The add/drop deadline is September 3. The withdrawal deadline is November 10. Midterm grades are due October 17. 

## Academic Honor Code
All members of the Regis University community exhibit the qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness in all academic activities, holding themselves and each other accountable for the integrity of the learning community.  Regis University students are committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and assume full and complete responsibility for maintaining those standard in the academic environment.

## Academic integrity violations
Violations of academic integrity are taken very seriously and include cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion and other forms of academic misconduct.  All violations will be reported with appropriate sanctions applied.  Sanctions can include, but are not limited to failure of an assignment, failure of a course, removal of academic honors, or review of the Academic Integrity Tutorial.  For more serious violations, program suspension, College dismissal or University expulsion may be imposed.  Refer to the Regis College Office of the Academic Dean for further information.  This Academic Honor Code applies to any student enrolled in a course at Regis University or one of its university partners, regardless of the student’s home college or program, and will be enforced according to the policies and procedures outlined in the University Academic Integrity Policy.  

It is the responsibility of each student to review all aspects of the course syllabus and agree to adhere to the Academic Honor Code.  In doing so, the student acknowledges that the work represented in all examinations and other assignments is his or her own and that he or she has neither given nor received unauthorized information.  Furthermore, the student agrees not to divulge the contents of any examination or assignment to another student in this or ensuing semesters.  

## Learning Support
If you have a documented disability requiring academic adjustments, please contact Dr. Joie Williams, Director of Disability Services (303-964-3666, mbwillia@regis.edu, Clark Hall 225).  She will review your documentation with you and help determine appropriate, reasonable accommodations.  Following the meeting with Dr. Williams, please make an appointment with your instructor to discuss your accommodation request in light of the course requirements.  You may self-disclose and request academic adjustments at any time during the semester.  However, it is strongly recommend that you do so as soon as possible because accommodations are not provided retroactively and adequate lead-time is required.

## Title IX and Regis’s Nondiscrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy
In the event that you choose to write or speak about having survived sexualized violence, including rape, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking and specify that this violence occurred while you were a Regis student, federal and state education laws require that, instructors notify the Regis University Title IX Coordinator, Michelle Spradling. She will contact you to let you know about accommodations and support services at Regis and requirements for holding accountable the person who harmed you. To learn more about Title IX, explicitly at Regis, go to http://www.regis.edu/About-Regis-University/University-Offices-and-Services/Campus-Safety/Title-IX.aspx
 
If you do not want the Title IX Coordinator notified, instead of disclosing this information to your instructor, you can speak confidentially with counselors in the Office of Counseling and Personal Development (see below) and the Blue Bench, a community agency that focuses on sexual assault and sponsors a 24/7 hotline. They can connect you with support services and discuss options for holding the perpetrator accountable. The number is 303-322-7273.

## Counseling
During the semester, if you find that life stressors are interfering with your academic or personal success, consider contacting the Office of Counseling and Personal Development (OCPD). All full-time Regis College students are eligible for counseling services at no charge. OCPD is located in the Coors Life Direction Center, Room 114 and can be contacted by phone 24/7 at 303-458-3507. For more information, see www.regis.edu/ocpd.

## Diversity and Inclusion
At Regis University the term “diversity” affirms our Jesuit commitment to build an inclusive community that values the dignity and contributions of all our members. We strive to shape a learning environment characterized by the Jesuit traditions of mutual respect and the pursuit of social justice, recognizing that our various identities and experiences, including but not limited to age, gender, race/ethnicity, class, disability, sexual orientation, religion and other forms of human difference, contribute to the richness and vitality of our Regis community, and those we are connected to locally, nationally, and globally. In accordance with our Jesuit Catholic mission, we commit ourselves to maintaining a humane atmosphere, where the human rights of every individual are recognized and respected. We desire that same commitment to be instilled in each member of our community and demonstrated through our words and actions. Should an individual ever feel as though these values are not being upheld in the academic or residential environment, we encourage that person to bring it to the Office of Diversity, Engagement and Inclusion in the Student Center, Suite 219; diverse@regis.edu or 303-964-6211.
