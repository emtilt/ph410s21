### For Wednesday
- Read Griffiths Section 3.2. (We won't spend much class time on this section, but you will have a homework question that uses it in the future.)

 Consider how the charge distribution would change if the inner conductor is shifted off-center, but still has $+Q$ on it, and the outer conductor remains electrically neutral. Draw the new charge distribution (little + and – signs) and be precise about how you know.

Note:
* Ask them for answers, put up on board and turn into clicker question
* Answer should be plusses on outside of inner and minuses inside of outer and plusses on outside of outer (equal numbers); shift only on outside of inner and inside of outer (no net field from them)

A long coax has total charge $+Q$ on the OUTER conductor. The INNER conductor is neutral.

What is the sign of the potential difference, $\Delta V = V(c)-V(0)$, between the center of the inner conductor ($s = 0$)
and the outside of the outer conductor?

1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C; there's no field inside at all

1. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{b}-\dfrac{1}{a}\right)$
2. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{a}-\dfrac{1}{b}\right)$
3. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{b^2}-\dfrac{1}{a^2}\right)$
4. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{a^2}-\dfrac{1}{b^2}\right)$
5. Something else?

Note: Correct Answer is B

You have two very large parallel plate capacitors, both with the same area and the same charge $Q$.
Capacitor \#1 has twice the gap of Capacitor \#2. Which has more stored potential energy?

1. \#1 has twice the stored energy
2. \#1 has more than twice
3. They both have the same
4. \#2 has twice the stored energy
5. \#2 has more than twice.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* E same; twice volume

A parallel plate capacitor is attached to a battery which maintains a constant voltage difference V between the capacitor plates.  While the battery is attached, the plates are pulled apart. The electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor

1. increases.
2. decreases.
3. stays constant.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Potential same; field is reduced; but shows up squared while d is increased, overall goes down
