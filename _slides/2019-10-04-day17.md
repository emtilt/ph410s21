<section data-markdown>

Say you have three functions $f(x)$, $g(y)$, and $h(z)$.
$f(x)$  depends on $x$ but not on $y$ or $z$.
$g(y)$ depends on $y$ but not on $x$ or $z$.
$h(z)$ depends on $z$ but not on $x$ or $y$.

If $f(x) + g(y) + h(z) = 0$ for all $x$, $y$, $z$, then:

1. All three functions are constants (i.e. they do not depend on $x$, $y$, $z$ at all.)
2. At least one of these functions has to be zero everywhere.
3. All of these functions have to be zero everywhere.
4. All three functions have to be linear functions in $x$, $y$, or $z$ respectively (such as $f(x)=ax+b$)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

If our general solution contains the function,

$$X(x) = Ae^{\sqrt{c}x} + Be^{-\sqrt{c}x}$$

What does our solution look like if $c<0$; what about if $c>0$?

1. Exponential; Sinusoidal
2. Sinusoidal; Exponential
3. Both Exponential
4. Both Sinusoidal
5. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

Our example problem has the following boundary conditions:

* $V(0,y>0) = 0; V(a,y>0) = 0$
* $V(x_{0\rightarrow a},y=0) = V_0; V(x,y\rightarrow \infty) = 0$

If $X''= c_1 X$ and $Y'' = c_2Y$ with $c_1 + c_2 = 0$, which is constant is positive?

1. $c_1$
2. $c_2$
3. It doesn't matter either can be

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Exponential solutions are expected in the y direction

Given the two diff. eq's :

$$\dfrac{1}{X}\dfrac{d^2X}{dx^2} = C_1 \qquad \dfrac{1}{Y}\dfrac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = C_2$$

where $C_1+C_2 = 0$.  Given the boundary conditions in the figure, which coordinate should be assigned to the negative constant (and thus the sinusoidal solutions)?

1. x
2. y
3. $C_1 = C_2 = 0$ here
4. It doesn't matter.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Because it has to vanish on both ends

2. $k = \pi/(2a)$
3. $k = \pi/a$
4. A and C
5. A, B, C

Note:

Suppose $V_1(r)$ and $V_2(r)$ are linearly independent functions which both solve Laplace's equation, $\nabla^2 V = 0$.

Does $aV_1(r)+bV_2(r)$ also solve it (with $a$ and $b$ constants)?

1. Yes. The Laplacian is a linear operator
2. No. The uniqueness theorem says this scenario is impossible, there are never two independent solutions!
3. It is a definite yes or no, but the reasons given above just aren't right!
4. It depends...


Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

What is the value of $\int_0^{a} \sin(n\pi x/a)\sin(m\pi x/a)\;dx$ ?

1. Zero
2. Non-zero
5. Depends on $n$ and $m$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* If n = m then integral is non-zero

Given that we want to solve Laplace's equation in 2D and that we have a description for the numerical second derivative of one variable,

$$f''(x) \approx \dfrac{f(x+a)-2f(x)+f(x-a)}{a^2}$$

what is the appropriate numerical partial derivative for $V(x,y)$, $\partial^2 V/\partial x^2 \approx$,

1. $$\left[V(x+a) - 2V(x) + V(x-a)\right]/a^2$$
2. $$\left[V(x+a,y) - 2V(x,y) + V(x-a,y)\right]/a^2$$
3. $$\left[V(y+a) - 2V(y) + V(y-a)\right]/a^2$$
4. $$\left[V(x,y+a) - 2V(x,y) + V(x,y-a)\right]/a^2$$
5. More than one is correct

Note:
* Correct answer: B is correct

Given that the potential at any point is given by the average of the surrounding points,

$$V(x,y) \approx \dfrac{1}{4}[ V(x+a,y) + V(x,y+a)$$
$$ +V(x-a,y) + V(x,y-a)]$$

Draft the psuedocode for finding the approximate potential.

Given $\nabla^2 V = 0$ in Cartesian coords, we separated $V(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. Will this approach work in spherical coordinates, i.e. can we separate $V(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi)$?


1. Sure.
2. Not quite - the angular components cannot be isolated, e.g., $f(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)Y(\theta,\phi)$
3. It won't work at all because the spherical form of Laplace's Equation has cross terms in it (see the front cover of Griffiths)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
