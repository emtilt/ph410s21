### Last time, we ended on boundary conditions. $\mathbf{E}$ can be discontinuous, but $V$ cannot. While we wait...

Without referring to Griffiths, use Gauss to calculate the E field above and below an infinite plane of surface charge $\sigma$. By how much is $\mathbf{E}$ discontinous, comparing points just above and just below the plane?

Does system energy "superpose"?

That is, if you have one system of charges with total stored energy $W_1$, and a second charge distribution with $W_2$...if you superpose these charge distributions, is the total energy of the new system simply $W_1 + W_2$?

1. Yes
2. No

3. remains constant.

A point charge $+q$ sits outside a **solid neutral conducting copper sphere** of radius $A$. The charge q is a distance $r > A$ from the center, on the right side. What is the E-field at the center of the sphere? (Assume equilibrium situation).

Consider how the charge distribution would change if the inner conductor is shifted off-center, but still has $+Q$ on it, and the outer conductor remains electrically neutral. Draw the new charge distribution (little + and – signs) and be precise about how you know.

Note:
* Ask them for answers, put up on board and turn into clicker question
* Answer should be plusses on outside of inner and minuses inside of outer and plusses on outside of outer (equal numbers); shift only on outside of inner and inside of outer (no net field from them)

</section>

<section data-markdown>

![alt text](../images/d12-coax_Qout.png "Logo Title Text 1")


Return the inner conductor to the center.

Instead of the total charge $+Q$ being on the inner conductor, sketch the charge distribution (little + and – signs) if the outer conductor has a total charge $+Q$ on it, and the inner conductor is electrically neutral. Be precise about exactly where the charge will be on these conductors, and how you know.

Note:
* Ask them for answers, put up on board and turn into clicker question
* Answer should be plusses on outside of outer; nothing else.
