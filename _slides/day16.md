$W_{sys}=\frac{1}{2}\int V(\vec{r^\prime})\rho(\vec{r^\prime})d\tau^\prime$

where $V(\vec{r^\prime})$ is the potential at $\vec{r^\prime}$ due to all of $\rho$ except right at $\vec{r^\prime}$ (so...everything)

Two charges, $+q$ and $-q$, are a distance $r$ apart.  As the charges are slowly moved together, the total field energy

$$\dfrac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int E^2 d\tau$$

1. increases
2. decreases
3. remains constant

(Hint: Think about the limiting case...)
Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Consider when they overlap, field goes to zero, must be E gets smaller as they get closer. same volume

A parallel-plate capacitor has $+Q$ on one plate, $-Q$ on the other.  The plates are isolated so the charge $Q$ cannot change.  As the plates are pulled apart, the total electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor:

1. increases
2. decreases
3. remains constant.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Same E; constant; larger volume where it is non-zero

<section data-markdown>

A typical metal has one free election per atom. These electrons are free to move in response to external electric fields. There are $\sim 10^{22}$ free electrons in a cubic centimeter of copper. Roughly what size of electric field could a single 1cm sub of copper "respond" to by polarizing?

1. 1 N/C
2. 10 N/C
3. 100 N/C
4. 1000 N/C
5. Something more than these


Note: Correct answer is E. It's closer to 10e17 N/C
