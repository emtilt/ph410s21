## Gauss' Law

![alt text](../images/d7-gauss_pt_charge.png "Logo Title Text 1")

$$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_V \dfrac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}d\tau$$

</section>

<section data-markdown>

(I) Electric field, (II) Electric flux, and/or (III) Electric charge

1. I only
2. I and II only
3. I and III only
4. II and III only
5. I, II, and II

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

The space in and around a cubical box (edge length $L$) is filled with a constant uniform electric field, $\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{y}$. What is the TOTAL electric flux $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ through this closed surface?

1. 0
2. $E_0L^2$
3. $2E_0L^2$
4. $6E_0L^2$
5. We don't know $\rho(r)$, so can't answer.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* All the incoming flux on the left side comes out the right side

A positive point charge $+q$ is placed outside a closed cylindrical surface as shown.  The closed surface consists of the flat end caps (labeled A and B) and the curved side surface (C). What is the sign of the electric flux through surface C?

![alt text](../images/d7-ABC_cylinder.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* This is meant to be hard to visualize, next slide illustrates it better.

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Some of the incoming flux through C goes out A and B.

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."
