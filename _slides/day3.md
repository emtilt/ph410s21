Coulomb's Law: $\mathbf{F}  = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{\left|\mathfrak{R}\right|^2}\hat{\mathfrak{R}}$ where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the relative position vector. In the figure, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are 2 m apart. Which arrow **can** represent $\hat{\mathfrak{R}}$?

![alt text](../images/d2-twochargeunit.png "Logo Title Text 1") 

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. More than one (or NONE) of the above
5. You can't decide until you know if $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the same or opposite charges

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* A unit vector has no units; so it's length is meaningless on a picture with units.
* Fall 2016 (hint given while still open): 14 10 9 [44] 23; students wanted to discuss E

Which of the following two fields has zero divergence?

| I | II |
|:-:|:-:|
| ![alt text](../images/d2-leftfield.png "Logo Title Text 1") | ![alt text](../images/d2-rightfield.png "Logo Title Text 1")  |

1. Both do.
2. Only I is zero
3. Only II is zero
4. Neither is zero
5. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about dE/dx and dE/dy

If these are electric field lines from a point charge in 3D space, what is the divergence in the boxed region?

![alt text](../images/d3-divredbox.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. Zero
2. Not zero
3. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* Lines in; lines out - harder to see dE/dx and dE/dy
* One of those curious ones where the 2D picture might get in the way; think 3D

**True or False** The following mathematical operation makes sense and is technically valid.

$$\nabla \cdot \nabla T(x,y,z)$$

1. Yes, it will produce a vector field.
2. Yes, it will produce a scalar field.
3. No, you can not take the divergence of a scalar field.
4. I don't remember what this means.

Note:
* Correct answer: B
