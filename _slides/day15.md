Could this be a plot of $\left|\mathbf{E}(r)\right|$? Or $V(r)$? (for SOME physical situation?)

1. Could be $E(r)$, or $V(r)$
2. Could be $E(r)$, but can't be $V(r)$
3. Can't be $E(r)$, could be $V(r)$
4. Can't be either

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

We usually choose $V(r\rightarrow\infty) \equiv 0$ when calculating the potential of a point charge to be $V(r) = +kq/r$. How does the potential $V(r)$ change if we choose our reference point to be $V(R) = 0$ where $R$ is close to $+q$.

1. $V(r)$ higher than it was before
2. $V(r)$ is lower than it was before
4. $V(r)$ doesnâ€™t change ($V$ is independent of  choice of reference)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Show redefinition.
