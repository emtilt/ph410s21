Homework 4 is one additional brief application of Gauss's law, which will introduct the idea of thinking about arbitrary positions which must be handled with a careful application of your knowledge of separation vectors.

All work should be turned in via GitHub classroom. [This guide shows how to use the GitHub Desktop app to manage these files](https://emtilt.github.io/guides/githubclass/); alternately, you can upload files directly. In general, you will need to create or edit Jupyer notebooks, and you will need to scan and upload PDFs of handwritten work. For this assignment, the link to accept the assignment is: []()

### 1. Overlapping clouds of charge

When solving some E&M problems, you will need to develop your solution using an arbitrary location. In this problem, consider how choosing an **arbitrary point** in the overlapping region of the charge clouds will help you derive the result.

When working on this problem, be sure you draw a good diagram -- it'll be hard to complete without one.

1. Consider two oppositely charged clouds (radii, $R$), both with known uniform charge densities $\rho$. They overlap as in the figure, with their centers separated by $d$; therefore, the separation vector from the positive sphere to the other could be expresssed such that $d=\left\lvert\vec{d}\right\rvert$. Find the electric field in the overlapping region. Express your answer in terms of common constants and variables defined in this problem. (*Hint: Consider how Gauss' Law and superposition can help here. You should already know how to find the field inside each sphere separately -- is there a way to use that knowledge? I found it useful to define some additional vector variables.*)
2. In this overlapping region, sketch the electric field lines.
3. In the limit that $d$ becomes very small compared to $R$, discuss in words and make a sketch of what the resulting (total, physical) charge distribution in space really looks like. Is this similar in any way to the physical situation in some other system that you have studied before? (So that later in the course when we encounter such a charge distribution, we will know where it came from and what the electric field looks like inside!)
