Homework 6 focuses on Laplaceâ€™s equations and solving it using infinite series solutions. You should become comfortable with setting boundary conditions for PDE problems like this and develop a sense of the process for solving these problems analytically. Additionaly, you will plot these solutions in 2D and develop the method of relaxation in 1D to investigate issues with the method.

All work should be turned in via GitHub classroom. [This guide shows how to use the GitHub Desktop app to manage these files](https://emtilt.github.io/guides/githubclass/); alternately, you can upload files directly. In general, you will need to create or edit Jupyer notebooks, and you will need to scan and upload PDFs of handwritten work. For this assignment, the link to accept the assignment is: [https://classroom.github.com/a/t4iIHMqZ](https://classroom.github.com/a/t4iIHMqZ)


## 1. Method of relaxation in 1D

In this problem, you will write a 1D method of relaxation solver for Laplace's equation. Your solver should start with boundary conditions (e.g., $V(0) = 0$ and $V(1) = 1$) and then use the method of relaxation to develop a linear solution (in 1D, we *know* that the solution should turn out linear, so this let's you check that your code works). Though this solver might seems trivial because the solution is obvious in 1D, this will allow you to get a feel for implementing the method before I ask you to expand it to 2D next week. Secondly, you will investigate what happens when you make bad initial guesses. Your solution to this problem should take the form of a Python notebook.

Let me briefly remind you of the pseudocode that we developed in class:

* Cut up the space into equal size bins (called the mesh) of size $a$
* Set the boundary conditions at V(left side) and V(right side)
* Make some reasonable guess for all the values in between
* Set a maximum number of iterations (just in case -- we don't want infinite loops)
* For each value **not** at the boundary set it equal to average of the surrounding two points
  - Compute the error (e.g., the difference between all the points before and after the previous step)
  - Compare the error to your acceptable value
  - Repeat the averaging until you reach the acceptable value or hit the maximum iterations
* Plot your results

Your solution to this problem should address the following:
1. For at least one set of boundary conditions, plot all the estimates of the potential until your answer converges (to demonstrate how the algorithm works)
2. Plot how many iterations it takes to achieve different levels of acceptable error (0.1, 0.01, etc.). Do not go too small because your code may run for a very long time.
3. Attempt to increase/reduce the number of iterations with poorer/better initial guesses. What kinds of initial guesses coverge the quickest, which ones are the slowest to coverge?
4. Find guesses that throw off the algorithm (i.e., give nonsensiscal answers). Griffith's mentions this in the book: the method of relaxation works for "reasonable initial guesses." As a hint, try sinsoudial, expoential, or logarithmic guesses. If you can't find something that breaks your algorithm, at least identify and demonstrate some initial conditions that cause it to take much longer to converge toward the true solution.



## 2. Potential in a cubical box

You have a cubical box (sides all of length $a$) made of 6 metal plates that are insulated from each other. The left wall is located at $y=-a/2$ and the right wall is at $y=+a/2$. Both left and right walls are held at constant potential $V=V_0$. All four other walls are grounded ($V=0$ for these walls).

(Note that I've set up the geometry so the cube runs from $x=0$ to $x=a$, and from $z=0$ to $z=a$,  but from $y=-a/2$ to $y=+a/2$  This should actually make the math work out a little easier!)

1. Find the potential $V(x,y,z)$ everywhere inside the box.
2. Is V=0 at the center of this cube?
3. Is E=0 at the center of the cube? Why, or why not?

## 3. Potential and electric field with Laplace's equation

In class we derived the solution for the 2D version of Laplace's equation with the boundary conditions shown below (we'll finish this derivation on Monday, March 15).

That solution was analytic, but it contained an infinite series:

$$V(x,y) = \sum_{n=1,3,5,\dots}^{\infty} \dfrac{4 V_0}{\pi n} \sin \left(\dfrac{n\pi x}{a}\right)e^{-\dfrac{n\pi y}{a}}$$


While perfectly analytic, this solution is hard to visualize. What does that solution look like? Take $V_0 = 10V$ and $a = 1m$.

1. Plot the approximate solution in 3D space using Python's ```mplot3D``` for just the first term in the sum (i.e., only for $n = 1$). The Jupyter notebook called `HW6-3dPotentialPlot.ipynb` is located in the GitHub repo and walks you through how to plot in 3D.
2. Plot the approximate solution in 3D space for the first 5 terms. What do you notice about the boundary where $V=V_0$?
3. Plot the approximate solution for the first 100 terms. If you didn't do it for Part 2, you will have to figure out how to automatically compute each term to construct your plot instead of copying-and-pasting 100 times!
4. Given this plot of the potential, sketch (by hand) what the electric field looks like. Recall that $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$.



## 4. Separation of variables - Cartesian 2D with new Boundary Conditions

A square rectangular pipe (sides of length $a$) runs parallel to the z-axis (from $-\infty$ to $\infty$)  The 4 sides are maintained with boundary conditions given in the figure. (Each of the 4 sides is insulated from the others at the corners).

![Tube](../../images/hw6-tube_2.png "Tube")


1. Find the potential $V(x,y,z)$ at all points in this pipe.
2. Sketch the E-field lines and equipotential contours inside the pipe. 
3. State in words what the boundary condition on the bottom wall means - what does it tell you? Is the bottom wall a conductor? (Bonus of one half-point: What physical situation would produce such a boundary condition? That is, how would an experimentalist arrange things so as to guarantee that $\partial V/\partial y=0$  on the 4th side?)    
3. Find the charge density $\sigma(x=0,y,z)$ everywhere on the left conducting wall ($x=0$).
