Homework 7  begins to introduce practice thinking about the Laplace equation.

All work should be turned in via GitHub classroom. [This guide shows how to use the GitHub Desktop app to manage these files](https://emtilt.github.io/guides/githubclass/); alternately, you can upload files directly. In general, you will need to create or edit Jupyer notebooks, and you will need to scan and upload PDFs of handwritten work. For this assignment, the link to accept the assignment is: [https://classroom.github.com/a/FOvfuBiF](https://classroom.github.com/a/FOvfuBiF)



### 1. Proving Uniqueness

For this homework problem, you will prove the "second uniqueness theorem" yourself, using a slightly different method than what Griffiths does (though you may find some common ideas are involved). It will really help to review/read the section on the second uniqueness theorem as you work through this problem. On the first two homeworks, I was quite forgiving of imprecision and lack of clarity in vector proofs; I will now expect completely clear and rigorous logic.

**Do it like this:**

1. Complete Griffiths Problem 1.61 part c. That is, use the divergence theorem and Product Rule 5 to prove Green's Identity: 
   
   $$\int_V \left(T \nabla^2 U + \nabla T \cdot \nabla U\right) d\tau = \oint_S \left(T \nabla U\right)\cdot d\mathbf{A}.$$ 

   (Hint: Let $\mathbf{v}=T\nabla U$ in the divergence theorem.)

2.  Now prove the second uniqueness theorem. Green's Identity is true for **any** choice of $T$ and $U$, so let the functions $T$ and $U$ in that identity both be the **same** function. Specifically, you should set them both equal to $V_3=V_1-V_2$ where $V_1$ and $V_2$ represent *different* solutions to the same boundary value problem ($\nabla^2 V = 0$ with boundary conditions). Then, using Green's Identity (along with some arguments about what happens at the boundaries, rather like Griffiths uses in his proof) should let you  show that $E_3$, which is defined to be the negative gradient of $V_3$ (as usual), must vanish everywhere throughout the volume.  That will complete the proof.

Work to understand the game, here: the goal, the strategy, and the result. We are checking if there are two different potential functions, $V_1$ and $V_2$, each of which satisfies Laplace's equation throughout the region we're considering. You construct (define) $V_3$ to be the difference of these, and you prove that $V_3$ (or in this case, $\mathbf{E}_3$) must vanish everywhere in the region. This means there really is only one unique E-field throughout the region after all.  This is a rather *formal manipulation* type of problem, giving you a chance to practice with the divergence theorem and think about what boundary conditions really mean.

### 2. The Method of Images -- The corner problem 

In this problem, it may or may not help you to work on the two parts simultaneously or out of order. The second part is just a tool for visualizing the first part.

![images Charges](../../images/hw5-images.png "image Charges")

1. Obtain a formula for the voltage $V(x,y,z)$ arising from a single point charge $+q$ located symmetrically a distance a from the inside corner formed by bending an infinite, grounded metal sheet through a right angle. (Hint: You'll need more than one "image" charge. Like all "method of images" problems, there isn't actually much math to do here other than getting the charge locations and distances correct.) 

2. The hardest thing about coming up with these "image" solutions is having a good intuition for what fields and potentials look like in different scenarios. Use the [PhET simulation *Charges and Fields*](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/charges-and-fields) to visualize your resulting E-field and some relevant equipotential contours (these can be added as green curves by using a tool on the right side of the simulation). Clearly illustrate how your images solve this problem by creating the appropriate equipotential. Take a screen shot and include it, with a few comments, to explain what you learned in this problem.
