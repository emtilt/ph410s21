## Intro 
Homework is a huge aspect of this course, both in terms of learning and in terms of grade. Be sure you start early! I strongly encourage you to work together on these homework problems, but you must turn in your own work. Collaborate with integrity -- I am extremely serious about that this semester. Remember that collaborating is not copying.

This first homework is primarily concerned with getting up and running with Python and reviewing the vector calculus that Griffiths discusses in Chapter 1.

All work should be turned in via GitHub classroom. [This guide shows how to use the GitHub Desktop app to manage these files](https://emtilt.github.io/guides/githubclass/); alternately, you can upload files directly. In general, you will need to create or edit Jupyer notebooks, and you will need to scan and upload PDFs of handwritten work. For this assignment, the link to accept the assignment is: 

## 1. Getting started with our computer-based tools

In this class, we will use Python in Jupyter notebooks, Slack for communication and collaboration, and Github to host our code. Your first job is to get these up and running. For some of these tasks, I have [guides available that might help you](http://evantilton.com/guides/).

1. Ensure that you can access our Slack team reliably at [physicsatregis.slack.com](http://physicsatregis.slack.com). If you have a smartphone or laptop, I recommend, but don't require, that you install the relevant app. 
2. Set up Github.
    - Make a Github account if you don't already have one. You can use a throwaway email address (e.g., a free gmail address that you use for nothing else) if you want total anonymity and privacy, but I don't recommend it. Github is a great tool that you may want to use professionally in the future. I recommend that you create a username that you'd be happy to show to a future employer.
    - Decide how you will add your work to GitHub. You have two main options:
      - Install a git client to let you manage your GitHub files. The easiest way to do this is to install the Github Desktop app from \url{https://desktop.github.com/}. This is a graphical interface that lets you manage your code. 
      - Upload files directly on GitHub via a browser. This will be easier at the beginning, because you have less to learn, but more tedious in the long run.
3. Get access to a way of working on Python Jupyter notebooks. I strongly suggest installing Anaconda, especially if you have one personal computer that you will use regularly, but Google Colab is another decent option for a cloud-based solution. [Here is a very brief guide to setting up an Anaconda enviroment for this class](http://evantilton.com/guides/anacondaenv/).
4. I suggest testing that you can get a Jupyter notbook running. Try creating one, importing numpy (`import numpy as np`, for example), and doing some artihmetic. If you don't remember how to add numbers or print things, google it and see if you can figure it out. Just try a few things. If nothing works, ask for help on Slack. When you're done, just delete this test notebook if you no longer need it.

## 2. Vector math
Dot products and cross products will show up all over this course. Let's remind ourselves of their properties once more.
- Given the vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, write down the sum of the two vectors with standard mathematical notation in terms of their components (e.g., use notation like $A_x$, etc) and unit vectors (e.g., $\hat{x}$, etc) in Catesian coordinates.
- Given the vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, define the dot product with standard mathematical notation in two different ways, one using components and one using magnitudes/angles.
- Give a brief physical interpretation of what the dot product means or tells you (you can give a concrete example if you like).
- Given the vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, define the cross product with standard mathematical notation in two different ways, one using components and one using magnitudes/angles.
- Give a brief physical interpretation of what the cross product means or tells you (you can give a concrete example if you like).

## 3. What operations can be done to different kinds of functions?
1. Given an arbitrary **scalar** function $T(x,y,z)$ (e.g., the temperature at any point in the room or the pressure at any point in the ocean), which of the three main differencal caulculus operations (div, grad, and/or curl) can be used to operate on $T$? For each which can:
  - give a formula for the result,
  - explain in words how you would interpret the result, and
  - identify if the result a vector or scalar.
2. Given an arbitrary  **vector** function $\vec{V}(x,y,z)$ (e.g., the velocity of air flowing in the atmosphere), which of the three operations (div, grad, and/or curl) can be used to operate on $\vec{V}$? For each which can:
  - give a formula for the result,
  - explain in words how you would interpret the result, and
  - identify if the result a vector or scalar.

## 4. Determine the gradient of a scalar function
In Griffiths, $\vec{\mathfrak{r}}$ represents the separation vector between source charges $\langle x', y', z' \rangle$ and the field point (i.e., the location of a test charge) $\langle x, y, z \rangle$. I know that my "script-r" $\vec{\mathfrak{r}}$ looks a bit different than the one that Griffiths uses, but it's a hard character to typeset -- sorry. Lemme know if you're confused, and I'll help you reconcile the symbols. The separation vector is a **critically important** vector in electrodynamics as it underlies all of the mathematical models that describe how source charges produce electric and magnetic fields. You **must** make sure you understand its meaning -- make **sure** you understand the different vectors described in Griffiths Section 1.1.4. 

Let's get some familiarity with this quantity.
1. Calculate the gradient of the magnitude of the separation vector (i.e., $\nabla\|\vec{\mathfrak{r}}\|$).
2. Calculate the gradient of the inverse of the magnitude of the separation vector (i.e., $\nabla \dfrac{1}{\|\vec{\mathfrak{r}}\|}$).
3. Show the gradients of these functions can be written as functions of the separation vector ($\vec{\mathfrak{r}}$) and/or its magntiude ($\|\vec{\mathfrak{r}}\|$). (*Hint: Explicitly write out the function in Cartesian coordinates.*)


## 5. Analyzing divergence and curl visually
While it is important to be able to analytically calculate divergences and curls, it is also exceedingly useful to be able to identify them visually. This skill has many uses: it allows you to check the plausibility of analytical results or computer simulations, it can imply easier ways of solving some problems, and it can help you identify potential roadblocks when setting up experiments or simulations.Hence, visual inspection of a field (in our case, electromagnetic fields) is an important tool to understand which models might be used to analyze the field. This will also be important in our distinction between electric and magnetic fields, and will become even more useful when the fields begin to vary with time.

For each of the four vector fields sketched below:

1. Which of them have a nonzero *divergence* somewhere? (If the divergence is nonzero *only* at isolated points, which point(s) would that be?)
2. Which of the following fields have nonzero *curl* somewhere? (If the curl is nonzero *only* at isolated points, which point(s) would that be?)
3. Provide a brief explanation for each of your answers above.

## 6. Integrals
In this course, you will perform many different kinds of integrals, some of which you have seen in other courses. In this problem, we will practice those integration techniques. 

1. *Line (or path) integrals* - You may have encountered these when discussing energy and work in a previous physics class. We'll use them frequently, especially when we talk about electric potential.
  - Determine the work done by the vector force $\mathbf{F} = y^2\;\hat{x} - 2x^2\;\hat{y}$ along the path $y=x^2$ from (0,0) to (4,16). (Don't fret about the units. Just assume you're working in some unit system in which all these quantities are unitless, or if you prefer, think of this "work" as just an abstract mathematical construct instead of a real physical system.) In case you forgot, recall that $W=\int \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$.
  - Descibe in words what the line integral $W=\int \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$ is doing. What is being "summed up"? Why is there a dot product?
  - Is this line integral path-independent (i.e., is $\mathbf{F}$ a [conservative vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field))? Explain how you can tell.
2. *Surface integrals* - Calculating the flux through a particular surface is a common way of determine the electric field, and doing so requires evaluating a surface integral.
  - Evaluate the integral $\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$ where $\mathbf{v}(x,y,z) = 5x\;\hat{y} + 2y\;\hat{z}$ and $S$ is the rectangular surface lying in x-z plane from (0,0,0) to (1,0,5). Choose the direction of $+\hat{y}$ to be indicative of positive flux.
  - Explain how the resulting sign of the flux makes sense. You can use sketches or diagrams, if it helps.
3. *Volume integrals* - It will be common for you to determine the amount of total charge in a situation where the charge is distributed in space according to some function. You might be familiar with this concept from the perspective of distributed mass.
  - Consider two different spheres: one with uniform mass density, $\rho_0$, and the other with a radially varying density, $\rho(r)=\frac{3\rho_0}{4R^2}r^2$.
  - If both spheres have the same radius $R$, which has more mass?




## 7. Plotting vector functions with `matplotlib`
Physics is both a mathematical and visual science. It is important to develop the ability to sketch and plot figures of various types. For the early part of this class, plotting the field generated by electric charges is important to understanding the field itself. In this problem, you will learn to use the [`matplotlib` library](http://matplotlib.org) to [plot vector fields](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/quiver_demo.html). A starter Jupyter notebook called ``hw1-vectorfieldplotting.ipynb`` is in the GitHub repository for this homework assignment. It describes how this kind of plotting is done for a specific case ($\vec{v}(x,y)=y\hat{x}$). You will then do the same for other fields after learning the basics of Python. Be sure to complete everything that the notebook asks of you -- **there are tasks scattered throughout it**.

## 8. Useful vector proofs
In electromagnetism, developing a deep understanding of vector mathematics can facilitate a deeper understanding of the physical systems that we will investigate. Knowing how certain proofs are done can often help you simplify a complicated problem.

In this problem, you will learn how we often use general vector operations with unspecified surfaces to make general statements about the field. In Griffiths, you read about a few integral theorems: the gradient theorem, Gauss's theorem (for divergences), and Stokes' theorem (for curls). You will make use of those theorems to prove a few things to develop some intuition about vector calculus.

1. From vector calculus, we already know that the curl of any gradient of any scalar field is zero: $\nabla \times \nabla T(x,y,z) = 0 $.
  - Use the corollary of the gradient theorem, namely that closed loop integral of any gradient of a scalar field is zero, $\oint \nabla T\cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$, along with Stokes' theorem, $\int_S(\nabla \times \mathbf{v})\cdot d\mathbf{a} = \oint_C \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$, to demonstrate that the curl of a gradient is zero.
  - What is the essential argument that needs to be made that proves that the result is generalizable to any situation? (*Hint: The surface (S) and thus the line (C) that bounds the surface are not specified.*)
  - What does your result from the previous question tell you about possibility of swirliness of the gradient of a scalar field, $\nabla T$, over any specified surface? Explain our result in words. If it helps, you could imagine a particular scalar field, like temperature in a room or the electric potential. What does the gradient of that field tell you? Why logically must the curl of that gradient be zero?
2. From vector calculus, we already know that the divergence of the curl of any vector field is zero, $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) = 0$.
  - Use the corollary of Stokes' theorem, namely that the closed surface integral of the curl of a vector field is zero, $\oint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v})\cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0 $, along with the divergence theorem, $\int(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) d\tau = \oint_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{a}$, to demonstrate that the divergence of a curl is zero.
  - What is the essential argument that needs to be made the proves the result is generalizable to any situation? (*Hint: The volume (V) and thus the surface (S) that bounds it are not specified.*)

## 9. Applying vector calculus knowledge

Griffiths is often able to get to a result very quickly, with seemingly little work, often producing an extremely elegant argument in the process. He is able to do this by drawing on a deep understanding of vector calculus. Let's try to build some of that understanding by connecting concepts to proofs. For this problem, consider the surface integral that we define as the ''vector area'',

$$\mathbf{a} = \iint_S d\mathbf{a}$$

1. Consider a hemispherical bowl (a half sphere) of radius $R$ (this is an _open_ surface). Sketch the situation, and indicate a vector element $d\mathbf{a}$ in your sketch. In which direction will $\mathbf{a}$ point once the integral is complete? How do you know?
2. Without calculating anything, what is a reasonable guess for the value of $\vert\mathbf{a}\vert$? Why is that a reasonable guess?
3. Compute directly the value of $\mathbf{a}$ and comment on your guesses from parts 1 and 2. It's ok if your answers to parts 1 and 2 don't match the computed answer. What did you get right? What needs more work on your conceptualization?
4. The value of $\mathbf{a}$ takes on the same value for _any_ **closed** surface. What is a reasonable guess for $\mathbf{a}$ in this case? Why is that a reasonable guess?
5. Show using the divergence theorem what the value of $\mathbf{a}$ is for any closed surface. (Hint: Consider the implications of a _constant_ vector field, perhaps something like $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{c}T$ for constant vector $\mathbf{c}$ and arbitrary scalar field $T$, used in the divergence theorem.) Compare your result to your answer to part 4. Again, it's ok if your guess doesn't match the computed answer, but reflect and explain how your result makes sense. What did you get right? Did you have any misunderstandings?
