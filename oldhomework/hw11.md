## 0. Reevaluating Exam 2

An examination is one measure of your understanding at a given moment in time. It is often a stressful and high stakes situation, which means that folks tend to perform differently depending on how this situation affects them. My goal is not for you to merely to *perform* physics (i.e., just get the right answer), but to become reflective of your learning of physics (and of learning in general). To that end, I would like to invite you to re-solve the problems for which you were penalized on second exam. A blank version of the exam is posted on Slack.

In addition to solving the problems again, I would like you to write a short summary of what you felt like you did incorrectly at the time of the exam for each problem (i.e., what you think you got wrong and why) and how your solution resolves this problem (i.e., what approach you needed to take to solve the problem correctly). What I'm asking is that you *reflect* on your exam solutions and what understanding you needed to draw on to solve the problems.

You are welcome to work on the problems together, but your reflection should be your own and individualized. It is through this kind of thinking about our own learning that we become expert learners. 

**Completing this exercise will not count towards your homework, but will instead reward you with earning 40% of the lost credit back on your exam. To receive the additional credit, you must write a new, polished, perfect solution of any problem for which you were penalized as well as written reflective comments as described above.**


## 1. Spherical resistors

Resistors can take a number of forms; consider one constructed from two concentric metal spheres with a conducitng material filling the space between them. The spheres have radii $a$ and $b$ (with $a<b$) and the material has conductivity $\sigma$.

1. Show that the potential difference across them is a constant: $\Delta V$.
2. What is the resistance between the spheres in terms of $a$, $b$, and $\sigma$? (Hint: Find the current between them first.)
3. Suppose that you are on a large ship out at sea, and you want to determine the conductivity of seawater. You have two small, identical metal spheres on hand as well as plenty of wire. How will you do so? Derive any mathematical results that you require.

## 2. Moving in a Time-Varying Field

![moving loop](../../images/hw11-moving_loop.png)

A rectangular loop of metal wire, of width $w$, moving with constant speed $v$, is entering a region of uniform B-field. The B-field is out of the page and is increasing at a constant rate $B=B_0 + \alpha t$, where $B_0$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants.  At t = 0, the right edge of the loop is a distance $x_0$ into the field, as shown. Note that the EMF around the loop has two different causes: the motion of the loop and the changing of the B-field.

1. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the EMF around the loop as a function of time, while the loop is entering the field.
2. Is the induced current in the loop clockwise, counterclockwise, or is it impossible to determine without knowing the values of $v$ and $a$? Explain.
3. Explicitly check that your answer to part 1 makes sense by (i) checking units and (ii) considering the two cases $v = 0$ and  $\alpha = 0$.  Explain how these limits give answers you might expect.

## 3. Analyzing a single E&M wave

Consider the electric field $\mathbf{E}(x,y,z,t) = E_0\cos(k(x-ct))\hat{y}$ (where $k$ and $c$ are known constants).

1. What is the charge density $\rho (x,y,z,t)$ that this E field implies? What are the units of $k$ and $c$?
2. Come up with the simplest possible B field which satisfies Faraday’s law, given this E field. Then, CHECK that the remaining free-space Maxwell’s equations are satisfied, if you make the correct choice for the constant $c$. What is this required $c$? What is the required magnitude of the B field? What is the current density $\mathbf{J}(x,y,z,t) which this E and B field imply?
3. What is the Poynting vector, $\mathbf{S}$, associated with these fields? Describe in words what this E and B field look like. Can you "interpret" them physically? What does the constant "k" tell you? (Hint: You will need to look things up that we didn't explicitly cover in class for this part. See Section 8.1.2 in Griffiths.)
4. Does this set of E and B provide a valid, self-consistent, physically possible solution to Maxwell's equations? What's the physics here?
