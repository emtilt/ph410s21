Current $I$ flows down a wire (length $L$) with a square cross section (side $a$). If it is uniformly distributed over the entire wire area, what is the magnitude of the volume current density $J$?

1. $J = I/a^2$
2. $J = I/a$
3. $J = I/4a$
4. $J = a^2I$
5. None of the above

We defined the volume current density in terms of the differential, $\mathbf{J} \equiv \dfrac{d\mathbf{I}}{da_{\perp}}$.

When is it ok to determine the volume current density by taking the ratio of current to cross-sectional area?
$$\mathbf{J} \stackrel{?}{=} \dfrac{\mathbf{I}}{A}$$

1. Never
2. Always
3. $I$ is uniform
4. $I$ is uniform and $A$ is $\perp$ to $I$
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

1. $K = I/a^2$
2. $K = I/a$
3. $K = I/4a$
4. $K = aI$
5. None of the above
