### Last time, we ended on boundary conditions. $\mathbf{E}$ can be discontinuous, but $V$ cannot. While we wait...

Without referring to Griffiths, use Gauss to calculate the E field above and below an infinite plane of surface charge $\sigma$. By how much is $\mathbf{E}$ discontinous, comparing points just above and just below the plane?

### Last time, we ended on boundary conditions

- $\mathbf{E}$ can be discontinuous, but $V$ cannot.
- $E^\perp_{\rm above}-E^\perp_{\rm below}=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$
- What about $E^\parallel$?

### Electrostatic Potential Energy

<section data-markdown>

Consider slowly moving a positive charge from a location of low electric potential to one of high electric potential. What is the sign of the work done by you ($W_u$)? What is the sign of the work done by electric field ($W_f$)?

1. $W_u < 0$; $W_f > 0$
2. $W_u < 0$; $W_f < 0$
3. $W_u > 0$; $W_f > 0$
4. $W_u > 0$; $W_f < 0$

Note: Correct Answer is D; Draw field

3. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{2q^2}{a}$
4. $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{3q^2}{a}$
5. Other
