The vector potential for the dipole is:

$\mathbf{A}_d = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi r^2} \mathbf{m} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}}$

What is the magnitude of that cross product $|\mathbf{m} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}}|$?

1. 1
2. $m$
3. $m r\sin\theta$

If the magnetic dipole moment points in the $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction, what is the direction of the $\mathbf{A}_d$?

1. $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$
2. $\hat{\mathbf{\phi}}$
3. $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$
4. $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$
5. Something else?

The force on a segment of wire $L$ is $\mathbf{F} = I \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}$ A current-carrying wire loop is in a constant magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B \hat{z}$ as shown. What is the direction of the torque on the loop?

1. Zero
2. +x
3. +y
4. +z
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
</section>

<section data-markdown>

The torque on a magnetic dipole in a B field is:

$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$

How will a small current loop line up if the B field points uniformly up the page?
