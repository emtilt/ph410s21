<section data-markdown>

A VERY thin slab of thickness $d$ and area $A$ has volume charge density $\rho = Q / V$. Because it's so thin, we may think of it as a surface charge density $\sigma = Q / A$.

![alt text](../images/d23-thin_slab_polarization.png "Logo Title Text 1")

The relation between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is:
1. $\sigma = \rho$
2. $\sigma = \rho d$
3. $\sigma = \rho/d$
4. $\sigma = V \rho$
5. $\sigma = \rho/V$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
