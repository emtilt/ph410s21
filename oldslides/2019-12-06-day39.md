On slack while we wait...

The electric field for a plane wave is given by:

$$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{E}_0e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$$

The vector $\mathbf{k}$ tells you:

1. The direction of the electric field vector.
2. The speed of the traveling wave.
3. The direction the plane wave moves.
4. A direction perpendicular to the direction the plane wave moves
5. None of these/MORE than one of these/???


Note:
* Correct Answer: C

On slack while we wait...

The electric field for a plane wave is given by:

$$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{E}_0e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$$

Suppose $\mathbf{E}_0$ points in the $+x$ direction.
Which direction is this wave moving?

1. The $x$ direction.
2. The radial ($r$) direction
3. A direction perpendicular to both $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{x}$
4. The $\mathbf{k}$ direction
5. None of these/MORE than one of these

A wave is moving in the $+z$ direction:

$$f(x, y, z, t) = Re\left[A e^{i(kz – \omega t + \delta)}\right]$$

The value of $f$ at the point $(0,0,z_0, t)$ and the point at $(x, y, z_0 , t)$ are related how?

$f_1 = f (0,0,z_0 , t)$  vs.  $f_2  = f(x, y, z_0 , t)$

1. $f_1 = f_2$  always
2. $f_1 >$ or $<$ or $= f_2$  depending on the value of $x,y$

You have this solution to Maxwell's equations in vacuum:

$$\widetilde{\mathbf{E}}(x,y,z,t) = \widetilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 \exp\left[i\left(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t\right)\right]$$

If this wave travels in the $y$ direction, is polarized in the $x$ direction, and has a complex phase of 0, what is the $x$ component of the physical wave?

1. $E_x = E_0 \ cos\left(kx-\omega t\right)$
2. $E_x = E_0 \ cos\left(ky-\omega t\right)$
3. $E_x = E_0 \ cos\left(kz-\omega t\right)$
4. $E_x = E_0 \ cos\left(k_x x+k_y y-\omega t\right)$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

The electric fields of two EM waves in vacuum are both described by:

$$\mathbf{E} = E_0 \sin(kx-\omega t)\hat{y}$$

The "wave number" $k$ of wave 1 is larger than that of wave 2, $k_1 > k_2$. Which wave has the larger frequency $f$?

1. Wave 1
2. Wave 2
3. impossible to tell

Note:
* Correct Answer: A
* Same speed and thus wavelength of 1 is smaller, so frequency is higher

  If no sources and in material, Maxwell says:
  
  $$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{D}=0$$
  
  $$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$$
  
  $$\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
  
  $$\nabla\times\mathbf{H}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}$$
  
  where $\mathbf{D}=\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{B}/\mu_0-\mathbf{M}$

For a wave on a 1d string that hits a boundary between 2 strings of different material we get,

$$\widetilde{f}(z<0) = \widetilde{A}_I e^{i(k_1)z-\omega t} + \widetilde{A}_Re^{i(-k_1z-\omega t)}$$
$$\widetilde{f}(z>0) = \widetilde{A}_T e^{i(k_2)z-\omega t}$$

where continuity (BCs) give,

$$\widetilde{A}_R = \left(\dfrac{k_1-k_2}{k_1+k_2}\right)\widetilde{A}_I$$
$$\widetilde{A}_T = \left(\dfrac{2k_1}{k_1+k_2}\right)\widetilde{A}_I$$

Is the transmitted wave in phase with the incident wave?

A) Yes, always B) No, never C) Depends

Note:
* Correct answer: A
