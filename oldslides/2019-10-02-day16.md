Griffiths, in a minor parenthetical aside: "This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation, on which computer solutions to Laplace's equation are based..."

You know what this means, right?

### Method of Relaxation

Note:
"The figure above shows the solution, V(x), after 100, 200, 400, and 800 steps. From this we can see that after 800 steps the solution is close the the anticipated straight line" Source http://astro.physics.ncsu.edu/urca/course_files/Lesson25/index.html

Consider a function $f(x)$ that is both continuous and continuously differentiable over some domain. Given a step size of $a$, which could be an approximate derivative of this function somewhere in that domain? $df/dx \approx$

1. $f(x_i+a) - f(x_i)$
2. $f(x_i) - f(x_i-a)$
3. $\frac{f(x_i+a) - f(x_i)}{a}$
4. $\frac{f(x_i) - f(x_i-a)}{a}$
5. More than one of these


Note:
* Correct Answer: E (C and D)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
If we choose to use:

$$\dfrac{df}{dx} \approx \dfrac{f(x_i+a) - f(x_i)}{a}$$

Where are we computing the approximate derivative?

1. $a$
2. $x_i$
3. $x_i + a$
4. Somewhere else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D (it's halfway between)

</section>

<section data-markdown>

Taking the second derivative of $f(x)$ discretely is as simple as applying the discrete definition of the derivative,

$$f''(x_i) \approx \dfrac{f'(x_i + a/2) - f'(x_i - a/2)}{a}$$

Derive the second derivative in terms of $f$.

With the approximate form of Laplace's equation:

$\dfrac{V(x_i+a) - 2V(x_i) + V(x_i-a)}{a} \approx 0$

What is a the appropriate estimate of $V(x_i)$?

1. ${1}/{2}(V(x_i+a)-V(x_i-a))$
2. ${1}/{2}(V(x_i+a)+V(x_i-a))$
3. ${a}/{2}(V(x_i+a)-V(x_i-a))$
4. ${a}/{2}(V(x_i+a)+V(x_i-a))$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: B

</section>


<section data-markdown>

To investigate the convergence, we must compare the estimate of $V$ before and after each calculation. For our 1D relaxation code, $V$ will be a 1D array. For the kth estimate, we can compare $V_k$ against its previous value by simply taking the difference.

Store this in a variable called ``err``. What is the type for ``err``?

1. A single number
2. A 1D array
3. A 2D array
4. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

</section>

<section data-markdown>

The Method of Relaxation also works for Poisson's equation (i.e., when there is charge!).

Given, $\nabla^2 V \approx \dfrac{V(x+a)-2V(x)+V(x-a)}{a^2}$

Which equations describes the appropriate "averaging" that we must do:

1. $V(x) = \dfrac{1}{2}(V(x+a)-V(x-a))$
2. $V(x) = \dfrac{\rho(x)}{\varepsilon_0}+\dfrac{1}{2}(V(x+a)+V(x-a))$
3. $V(x) = \dfrac{a^2\rho(x)}{2\varepsilon_0}+\dfrac{1}{2}(V(x+a)+V(x-a))$

Note:
* Correct answer: C

<section data-markdown>

Given that we want to solve Laplace's equation in 2D and that we have a description for the numerical second derivative of one variable,

$$f''(x) \approx \dfrac{f(x+a)-2f(x)+f(x-a)}{a^2}$$

what is the appropriate numerical partial derivative for $V(x,y)$, $\partial^2 V/\partial x^2 \approx$,

1. $$\left[V(x+a) - 2V(x) + V(x-a)\right]/a^2$$
2. $$\left[V(x+a,y) - 2V(x,y) + V(x-a,y)\right]/a^2$$
3. $$\left[V(y+a) - 2V(y) + V(y-a)\right]/a^2$$
4. $$\left[V(x,y+a) - 2V(x,y) + V(x,y-a)\right]/a^2$$
5. More than one is correct

Note:
* Correct answer: B is correct

<section data-markdown>

Given that the potential at any point is given by the average of the surrounding points,

$$V(x,y) \approx \dfrac{1}{4}[ V(x+a,y) + V(x,y+a)$$
$$ +V(x-a,y) + V(x,y-a)]$$

Draft the psuedocode for finding the approximate potential.
