## Gauss' Law

![alt text](../images/d7-gauss_pt_charge.png "Logo Title Text 1")

$$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_V \dfrac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}d\tau$$

The space in and around a cubical box (edge length $L$) is filled with a constant uniform electric field, $\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{y}$. What is the TOTAL electric flux $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ through this closed surface?

1. 0
2. $E_0L^2$
3. $2E_0L^2$
4. $6E_0L^2$
5. We don't know $\rho(r)$, so can't answer.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* All the incoming flux on the left side comes out the right side

A positive point charge $+q$ is placed outside a closed cylindrical surface as shown.  The closed surface consists of the flat end caps (labeled A and B) and the curved side surface (C). What is the sign of the electric flux through surface C?

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* This is meant to be hard to visualize, next slide illustrates it better.

Let's get a better look at the side view.

1. positive
2. negative
3. zero
4. not enough information given to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Some of the incoming flux through C goes out A and B.

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."
