### PH410 - Electromagnetism

November 18

For Wednesday, read section 6.4 (i.e., finish chapter 6)
</section>


<section data-markdown>

Consider a paramagnetic material placed in a uniform external magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$. The paramagnetic magnetizes, so that the total magnetic field just outside the material is now...

1. smaller than
2. larger than
3. the same as

it was before the material was placed.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

A small chunk of material (the “tan cube”) is placed above a solenoid. It magnetizes, weakly, as shown by small arrows inside.
What kind of material must the cube be?

A solid cylinder has uniform magnetization $\mathbf{M}$ throughout the volume in the $\phi$ direction as shown. In which direction does the bound surface current flow on the (curved) sides?

1. There is no bound surface current.
2. The current flows in the $\pm \phi$ direction.
3. The current flows in the $\pm s$ direction.
4. The current flows in the $\pm z$ direction.
5. The direction is more complicated.
