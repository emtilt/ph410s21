Work together as necessary, but make sure you're thinking through everything, not just copying.

### Because of superposition, to find $\vec{E}$ we can:

- Start from Coulomb's Law: $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=k\int\frac{1}{\left|\mathfrak{r}\right|^2}\hat{\mathfrak{r}}dq$
- Express $dq \rightarrow \lambda~dl' \sim \sigma da' \sim \rho d\tau'$
- Compute the integral in convenient coordinates
</section>
<section data-markdown>
We obtained:
$$E(z)=2\pi k\lambda \frac{az}{\left(a^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}} $$


If we are *far from the disk*, what is the small parameter in our Taylor expansion?

1. $z$
2. $a$
3. $z/a$
4. $a/z$
5. More than one of these

Note: Correct answer is D, but this is about a discussion about dimensionless parameters - small compared to what!

We have shown twice that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$ using what seem to be appropriate vector identities. But physically, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ \varepsilon_0$. What is going on?!

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $â€“q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though?

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

<img src ="./images/slac_overhead.jpg" align="center" style="width: 700px";/>

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<img src ="./images/cylinder_slac.png" align="left" style="width: 300px";/>

One afternoon, the beam line is struck by lightning, which gives it a uniform
surface charge density $+\sigma$. Does that affect the experiment?!

What is the infinitesimal area, $dA$, of a small patch on a cylindrical shell centered
on the z-axis?

1. $d\phi\,dz$
2. $s\,d\phi\,dz$
3. $s\,ds\,d\phi$
4. $ds\,dz$
5. Something else

Note: Correct answer B

2. Exactly radially outward
3. Roughly radially inward

Which way does the electric field due to the positive charges resting on the beam line point for locations _inside the pipe_ far from the ends?

Consider a cube of constant charge density centered at the origin.

**True or False**: I can use Gauss' Law to find the electric field directly above the center of the cube.

1. True and I can argue how we'd do it.
2. True. I'm sure we can, but I don't see how to just yet.
3. False. I'm pretty sure we can't, but I can't say exactly why.
4. False and I can argue why we can't do it.

2. $r^2 d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$

</section>


<section data-markdown>

Consider an infinite sheet of charge with uniform surface charge density $+\sigma$ lying in the $x-y$ plane. From symmetry arguments, we can argue that $\mathbf{E}(x,y,z)$ can be simplified to:

1. $\mathbf{E}(x,y)$; direction undetermined
2. $E_z(x,y)$
3. $\mathbf{E}(z)$; direction undetermined
4. $E_z(z)$
5. Something else

</section>

<section data-markdown>

We derived that the electric field due to an infinite sheet with charge density $\sigma$ was as follows:

$$\mathbf{E}(z) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{k} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{ z > 0} \cr \dfrac{-\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{k} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{ z < 0}\end{cases}$$

What does that tell you about the difference in the field when we cross the sheet, $\mathbf{E}(+z)-\mathbf{E}(-z)$?

1. it's zero
2. it's $\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$
3. it's -$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$
4. it's +$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0} \hat{k}$
5. it's -$\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0} \hat{k}$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* Makes for a good discussion about cross one direction versus the other

What is the curl of the vector field, $\mathbf{v}= c\hat{\phi}$, in the region shown below?

<img src="./images/c_phi_field.png" align="right" style="width: 300px";/>

1. non-zero everywhere

What is the curl of this vector field, in the red region shown below?

<img src="./images/curl_red_box.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/>

1. non-zero everywhere in the box
2. non-zero at a limited set of points
3. zero curl everywhere shown
4. we need a formula to decide

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* I think it's D because it depends on how the field drops off, which we haven't indicated. If it's drops off like 1/r, then it has no curl.
