While we wait, answer this:

A solution to the wave equation is:
$$f(z,t) = A \cos(kz – \omega t + \delta)$$

* What is the speed of this wave?
* Which way is it moving?
* If $\delta$ is small (and >0), is this wave "delayed" or "advanced"?
* What is the frequency?
* The angular frequency?
* The wavelength?
* The wave number?

A solution to the wave equation is:
$$f(z,t) = Re\left[A e^{i(kz – \omega t + \delta)}\right]$$

* What is the speed of this wave?
* Which way is it moving?
* If $\delta$ is small (and >0), is this wave "delayed" or "advanced"?
* What is the frequency?
* The angular frequency?
* The wavelength?
* The wave number?

A complex solution to the wave equation in 3D is:

$$\widetilde{f}(\mathbf{r},t) = \widetilde{A}e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)}$$


* What is the speed of this wave?
* Which way is it moving?
* Why is there no $\delta$?
* What is the frequency?
* The angular frequency?
* The wavelength?
* The wave number?

Is "The Wave" at the stadium a transverse wave or a longitudinal wave?
1. Transverse
2. Longitudinal
3. Neither

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

</section>

<section data-markdown>

A wave on a stretched drum head is an example of a:
1. transverse wave
2. longitudinal wave
3. it's not a wave at all

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

  If no sources, Maxwell says:
  
  $$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=0$$
  
  $$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$$
  
  $$\nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
  
  $$\nabla\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

  Taking curl of Faraday:

  $$\nabla\times\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}\right)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\right)$$
  
  $$\nabla\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}\right)-\nabla^2\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\right)$$
  
  $$\nabla^2\mathbf{E}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

  Similarly from Ampere:   $\nabla^2\mathbf{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}$
