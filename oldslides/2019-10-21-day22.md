## Multipole Expansion

![alt text](../images/d21-universe_multipole.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

Multipole Expansion of the Power Spectrum of CMBR

Note: The radiation from cosmic microwave background can be described in terms of contributions using a basis of functions with increasing smaller contributions.

Two charges are positioned as shown to the left. The relative position vector between them is $\mathbf{d}$. What is the dipole moment of this configuration?

$$\sum_i q_i \mathbf{r}_i$$

1. $+q\mathbf{d}$
2. $-q\mathbf{d}$
3. Zero
4. None of these; it's more complicated than before!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

<section data-markdown>
  $$R_\pm=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+\left(z\mp d/2\right)^2}$$
  $$R_\pm=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+\left(z^2+d^2/4\mp dz\right)}$$
  $$R_\pm=\sqrt{\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)\mp dz+d^2/4}=\sqrt{r^2\mp dz+d^2/4}$$
  $$R_\pm=r\sqrt{1\mp \frac{dz}{r^2}+\frac{d^2}{4r^2}}$$

For a dipole at the origin pointing in the z-direction, we have derived:

$$\mathbf{E}_{dip}(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{p}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3}\left(2 \cos \theta\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin \theta\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)$$

![alt text](../images/d21-small_dipole.png "Logo Title Text 1")


For the dipole $\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{d}$ shown, what does the formula predict for the direction of $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}=0)$?

1. Down
2. Up
3. Some other direction
4. The formula doesn't apply

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* The formula works far from the dipole only.

</section>

<section data-markdown>

**True or False**: The electric potential of a pure dipole is given exactly by:

$$V(r) = \dfrac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}}{4 \pi\varepsilon_0 r^3}$$

1. True
2. False

![alt text](../images/d21-2q_dipole.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. qd
2. 2qd
3. 3qd
4. 4qd
5. It's not determined

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

What is the dipole moment of this system?

(BTW, it is NOT overall neutral!)

1. $q\mathbf{d}$
2. $2q\mathbf{d}$
3. $\frac{3}{2}q\mathbf{d}$
4. $3q\mathbf{d}$
5. Someting else (or not defined)

![alt text](../images/d21-dipole_2q_and_q_shift.png "Logo Title Text 1")

What is the dipole moment of this system?

(Same as last question, just shifted in $z$.)

1. $q\mathbf{d}$
2. $2q\mathbf{d}$
3. $\frac{3}{2}q\mathbf{d}$
4. $3q\mathbf{d}$
5. Someting else (or not defined)

<section data-markdown>

You have a physical dipole, $+q$ and $-q$ a finite distance $d$ apart. When can you use the expression:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\dfrac{\mathbf{p}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

1. This is an exact expression everywhere.
2. It's valid for large $r$
3. It's valid for small $r$
4. No idea...
