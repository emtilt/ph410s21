### PH410 - Electromagnetism

December 2

For Wednesday, read 9.2 (you may need to skim/look things up in chapter 8)

A "right moving" solution to the wave equation is:

$$ f_R(z,t) = A \cos(kz – \omega t + \delta)$$

Which of these can be a "left moving" solution?

1. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t + \delta)$
2. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t - \delta)$
3. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t + \delta)$
4. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t - \delta)$
5. more than one of these!

(Assume $k, \omega, \delta$ are positive quantities)

Note:
* All of them could be because cos(x) = cos(-x)

Two different functions $f_1(x,t)$ and $f_2(x,t)$ are solutions of the wave equation.

$$\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{1}{c^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}$$

Is $(A f_1  + B f_2 )$  also a solution of the wave equation?

1. Yes, always
2. No, never
3. Yes, sometimes depending on $f_1$ and $f_2$

Note:
* Correct answer: A

Two traveling waves 1 and 2 are described by the equations:

$$y_1(x,t)  = 2 \sin(2x – t)$$
$$y_2(x,t)  =  4 \sin(x – 0.8 t)$$

All the numbers are in the appropriate SI (mks) units.
 
Which wave has the higher speed?
1. 1
2. 2
3. Both have the same speed

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
