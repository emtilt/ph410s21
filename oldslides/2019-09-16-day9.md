While we wait: Answer this and **sit by someone different today**.

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $–q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though? 
USED IN:  Spring 2013 (Pollock) 
LECTURE NUMBER:  5 (Gauss’ Law)
STUDENT RESPONSES:  12, [[84]], 2,2, 0  Sp ’13 (preclass question) 
INSTRUCTOR NOTES This was the “review’ question to start class. Most remembered Gauss law (which was on the board) to vote for A or B, but the debate was about whether the fact that the integral vanishes, does that mean E vanishes EVERYWHERE. It’s so important to understand that knowing the integral doesn’t by itself tell you about the integrand. (There was a lot of discussion, even though the end vote was solid)  -SJP
WRITTEN BY:  Steven Pollock (CU-Boulder) NEW in 2013, combining two older questions.

### For Wednesday
- Griffiths Section 2.4 (pp. 91-97)
- Reading survey

HW3 due Fiday
	
</section>
<section data-markdown="">

### HW1
Median=7.55

Per-Question Grades:
- check-plus = 1: Essentially perfect solution
- check = 0.85: Good attempt at problem with some errors
- check-minus = 0.6: Major errors and/or small missing portions
- check-double-minus = 0.45: Major errors throughout or major parts missing
- F = 0.3: Some work present, but insufficient attempt

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

<section data-markdown>

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. Can we use Gauss's Law ($\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$) to find $|\mathbf{E}|$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Maybe?

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

## Gauss's law

$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\frac{Q_{\rm enc}}{\epsilon_0}$

## Divergence theorem

$\oint_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\int_V\left( \nabla\cdot \mathbf{E}\right) d\tau$
