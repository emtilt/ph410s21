### Committment to an Inclusive Classroom

I'm committed to creating an inclusive classroom.  If I can do anything to make the classroom a better learning environment for you, please let me know.

If you observe or experience behaviors that violate our committment to inclusivity, please let me know.

If I violate this principle, please let me know or please tell the physics chair. I want to learn from my mistakes!

### Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

One of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences. I will seek to keep information you share private.

However, I'm required to share information regarding sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or information about criminal activity with the university.

Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Office of Counseling and Personal Development. OCPD is located in the Coors Life Direction Center, Room 114 and can be contacted by phone 24/7 at 303-458-3507. See www.regis.edu/ocpd.

### Homework problems

* We will be using Python on homework problems this semester. You are welcome to use any distribution, but I recommend [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* Installation help can be found at [evantilton.com/guides](http://evantilton.com/guides) or by talking on Slack
* Homework questions will take the form of a Jupyter notebook, which you can turn in by [linking a Github commit](http://evantilton.com/guides/linktogithubcommit/) via a Slack message. Make sure the file name clearly indicates what it is and who wrote it.
* If you get stuck somewhere, post on Slack, so your classmates benefit from your question. Use the channels and giphy responsibly.
* Regular written homework should be turned in on paper if handwritten. Alternately, you are welcome to typeset it in LaTeX or Markdown and share it via Slack or Github, but I won't accept it unless you typeset using standard mathematical notation and convention.
