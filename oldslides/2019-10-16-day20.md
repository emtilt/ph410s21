 Assume $V(r,\theta)=R(r)\Theta (\theta)$ and plug into Laplace:
 $$\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(R\Theta\right)\right)+\frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(R\Theta\right)\right)=0$$
 $$\frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial R}{\partial r}\right)}{R(r)}+\frac{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial\Theta}{\partial\theta}\right)}{\Theta\left(\theta\right)}=0$$

The ODE that describes the $R(r)$ part of our solution is:

$$\dfrac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\dfrac{dR}{dr}\right) = l(l+1)R$$

I claim this ODE gives rise to polynomial solutions.

Find a general solution for $R(r)$ in terms of $l$.

Let's take the $\Theta$ ODE term by term starting with $l=0$

$$\dfrac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin \theta \dfrac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) = 0$$

What are some possible solutions?

Hint: This is not as tricky as it might seem.

$$V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left(A_l r^l + \dfrac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}\right)P_l(\cos \theta)$$


V everywhere on a spherical shell is a given constant, i.e. $V(R,\theta) = V_0$. There are no charges inside the sphere. Which terms do you expect to appear when finding V(inside)?

1. Many $A_l$ terms (but no $B_l$'s)
2. Many $B_l$ terms (but no $A_l$'s)
3. Just $A_0$
4. Just $B_0$
5. Something else!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

The general solution for the electric potential in spherical coordinates with azimuthal symmetry (no $\phi$ dependence) is:

$$V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left(A_l r^l + \dfrac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}\right)P_l(\cos \theta)$$

Consider a metal sphere (constant potential in and on the sphere, remember). Which terms in the sum vanish outside the sphere? (Recall: $V \rightarrow 0$ as $r \rightarrow \infty$)

1. All the $A_l$'s
2. All the $A_l$'s except $A_0$
3. All the $B_l$'s
4. All the $B_l$'s except $B_0$
5. Something else

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* Only B0 will survive.

It's true that: $\int_{-1}^{+1}P_l(u)P_m(u)du = \dfrac{2}{2l+1}$ for $l=m$.

By what should we multiply $V_0(\theta) = \sum_l C_l P_l(\cos \theta)$ by to match this integral so we can use Fourier's Trick?

1. $P_m(\cos \theta)$
2. $P_m(\sin \theta)$
3. $P_m(\cos \theta) \sin \theta$
4. $P_m(\sin \theta) \cos \theta$
5. $P_m(\sin \theta) \sin \theta$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

How many boundary conditions (on the potential $V$) do you use to find $V$ inside the spherical plastic shell?

![alt text](../images/d20-plastic_shell_vtheta.png "Logo Title Text 1")

1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
5. It depends on $V_0(\theta)$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Good for discussion; obviously you need the surface BC, but what about at r=0? Is that technically a BC?

$$V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left(A_l r^l + \dfrac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}\right)P_l(\cos \theta)$$

Suppose V on a spherical shell is:

$$V(R,\theta) = V_0 \left(1+\cos^2\theta\right)$$

Which terms do you expect to appear when finding **V(inside)**?
1. Many $A_l$ terms (but no $B_l$'s)
2. Many $B_l$ terms (but no $A_l$'s)
3. Just $A_0$ and $A_2$
4. Just $B_0$ and $B_2$
5. Something else!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* Avoid blowup and match cosine

Consider a solid sphere of charge that has a charge density that varies with $\cos \theta$. What can we say about the terms in the general solution to Laplace's equation outside there sphere?

$$V(r,\theta) = \sum_l\left(A_l\,r^l + \dfrac{B_l}{r^{(l+1)}}\right)P_l(\cos \theta)$$

1. All the $A_l$'s are zero
2. All the $B_l$'s are zero
3. Only $A_0$ should remain
4. Only $B_0$ should remain
5. Something else

Note: Correct answer E because B0 and B1 remain
